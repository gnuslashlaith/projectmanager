# Project Manager

Heyhey! I am laith and this is my final project. It is essentially a way to have a place for all sorts of projects, keep track of how you're doing in each. I won't lie I'm a little disappointed since I had much more grand ideas for this but I think since Im quite new to web development and react this was a good start for me. 

I made this because I never really found a place to compile all of my progress with the projects that I do, especially since Im into a lot of different things (music, writing, coding, reading, poetry, physics, all that junk), so this
can allow me to see how I'm doing in real time. While I did have ideas about adding reminders and notifications and video and image adding stuff, I realize that I had a lot of trouble even getting the project IDs to sync -- so I decided to take one step at a time. If I ever continue this project then I'll think about adding all of that so it can be like a full digital project-journal, but I'm quite happy with what I have now. I will say debugging was a challenge. I
really hate how React (and javascript in general) like says all the errors after its been run so I have to go back and search for it like a D&D riddle. sighs

I did enjoy the UI stuff and just working on a project for a long period of time, I usually would have quit it completely so to see it ready and deployed brings me a lot of joyce.
